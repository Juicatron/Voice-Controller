# Voice Controller

## Overview:
Voice Command Controller is a Python-based application that allows users to control their computer using voice commands. The system integrates voice recognition with text-to-speech and keyboard control, providing a hands-free way to execute commands. The application includes a graphical user interface for easy configuration and management of voice commands and settings.

## Features:
- Voice Recognition: Uses Vosk for real-time voice recognition.
- Text-to-Speech: Provides voice feedback using pyttsx3.
- Keyboard Control: Executes keyboard commands based on recognized keywords.
- Graphical User Interface: Allows users to configure settings and manage keyword mappings.
- Automatic Setup: Installs required dependencies and creates necessary configuration files.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Dependencies: pyttsx3, vosk, pyaudio, pynput, tkinter

## Installation:
1. Press the green "Code" button on the repository page.
2. Download the ZIP file.
3. Extract the file to your desired directory.
4. Go to the Vosk website (https://alphacephei.com/vosk/)
    - download and extract the small package for your chosen language.
5. Download Python if you donâ€™t already have it.
    - Installation Guides: The Python documentation provides detailed installation instructions for different operating systems. Here are direct links to the installation sections:
        - Windows: [Installing Python on Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html)
        - macOS: [Installing Python on macOS](https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html)
        - Linux: [Installing Python on Linux](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html)
6. Open a terminal.
7. Move to the directory of the Voice Command Controller.
8. Run the application using:
    - python main.py

## Configuration:
1. Settings:
   - settings.json: Stores configuration settings such as voice feedback, model directory, and selected voice.
   - keyword_mappings.json: Stores keyword mappings for voice commands.

2. Adjust Settings:
   - Run the graphical user interface to configure settings and manage keyword mappings:
     python main_gui.py

## Usage:
1. Start the Application:
   python main.py
   This will start the main application, which initializes voice recognition and waits for commands.

2. Managing Mappings:
   - Use the GUI to add or modify keyword mappings.
   - Define keywords, associated keys, and feedback for each mapping.

3. Toggle Voice Recognition:
   - Use the GUI to enable or disable voice recognition.

## Files:
- main.py: Main script for running the voice command application.
- main_gui.py: GUI script for configuring settings and managing keyword mappings.
- settings.py: Manages application settings.
- setup.py: Sets up the environment by installing dependencies and creating configuration files.
- keyword_mappings.py: Manages keyword mappings and their display in the GUI.
- settings.json: Configuration file for application settings.
- keyword_mappings.json: Configuration file for keyword mappings.

## Troubleshooting:
- Missing Dependencies: If a required package is not installed, the setup script will attempt to install it. Ensure you have pip installed and accessible.
- Configuration Issues: If settings.json or keyword_mappings.json is missing or corrupted, the application will create default files.
